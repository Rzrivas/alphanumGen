-This is a small program that generates strings using 0-9 and a-z

To run just use "java alphanumGen" in command line

-It will request the length of key I've tested up to 5 and it 
takes a few minutes
-I originally used the program to output a text file for a
dictionary attack where I knew the length of the key and characters
-Now it just displays the keys
